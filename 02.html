    <h2>CSS란 무엇인가?</h2>
    <p>
      CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independently of the HTML that makes up each web page.
    </p>
    <p>
      CSS has become a crucial part of building websites and blogs. CSS goes hand in hand with HTML to display your website the way it's intended to be displayed. Here, you'll find CSS tutorials, code examples, and CSS reference material.

    <p>
      CSS has gone through some major changes since CSS level 1 became a W3C recommendation in December 1996. CSS1 describes the CSS language as well as a simple visual formatting model. CSS2, which became a W3C recommendation in May 1998, builds on CSS1 and adds support for media-specific style sheets (e.g. printers and aural devices), downloadable fonts, element positioning and tables.
