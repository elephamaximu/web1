    <h2>HTML이란 무엇인가?</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://quackit.com" target="_blank" title="Learn HTML">HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language,</a> is the standard markup language used to create web pages. HTML consists of HTML elements, which define the different parts of the document. The web developer uses HTML tags to specify which elements go on a given page. For example, you can use HTML tags to specify headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, images and much more.

      You don't need any special equipment or software to create HTML. In fact, you probably already have everything you need. Here is what you need:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Computer</li>
      <p>
        This is probably an obvious one. Tablets should be fine too, and maybe even your smartphone.
      </p>
      <li>HTML Editor</li>
      <p>
        An HTML editor is an application that helps you create HTML pages. While you can certainly create HTML documents using a simple text editor, an HTML editor will make your life easier — especially if you plan to write a lot of code.
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML editors usually highlight your code so that it's easier to read, and they will typically have an autocomplete feature that picks up on what you're typing, and makes valid HTML suggestions.
      </p>
      <li>Web Browser</li>
      <p>
        To view the results of your HTML code. OK, technically, you can create HTML without viewing the results, but where's the fun in that!
      </p>
    </ul>
